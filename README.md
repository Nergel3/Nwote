#### Introduction
Nwote is a **PWA** to write markdown (Github Flavored). It currently only support desktop browser but I'm working to make it work on mobile too.
The design is strongly inspired by the [app](https://github.com/notable/notable) of [Fabio Spampinato](https://github.com/fabiospampinato) and if you are looking for a desktop markdown editor you should take a look at his work.

Nwote v1.0.0 is build with the following awesome technologies :
* Progressive Web App
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) with [Quasar Framework](https://quasar.dev/) and [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)
* [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/index.html) for the editor (mobile support)
* [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) to parse the markdown.
* [IndexedDb API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Using_IndexedDB)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
